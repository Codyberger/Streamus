The server's modules are managed by NuGet Package Manager.

The server is used to record information about a given user's listening experience. All videos, playlist items, playlists and folders are written to the database.
The server is used to enable sharing of playlists between users by copying a playlist row and providing a link to the new row to other users.

The client is able to display and interact with YouTube videos. Videos added to a playlist are stored permanently until deletion. Videos added to the stream are able to be played.
The client is able to allow for discovery of new YouTube videos by suggesting future content based on related videos presently in a stream.
